# GoodTuring
A memory-efficient application of Good-Turing statistics to quantify the uncertainty of molecular dynamics simulations.

To use this program, you'll need a molecular dynamics trajectory (only DCD+PSF supported), the latest version of the program 'carma' from https://utopia.duth.gr/glykos/progs/ and the R package for statistical computing with the dpseg & minpack.lm libraries installed.
