These are the results from a 6.3 Î¼s folding simulation of the CLN025 peptide using the AMBER-99SB-ILDN force field. 

The graphs are in the PDF files (as produced by R). 

The file 'GT_Screenshot.png' is the log produced on the interactive shell.

The file 'Comparison.png' illustrates the form of the results for folding simulations of different peptides/proteins (and with different simulations lengths). The Good-Turing graphs are estimates of how probable it is to observe structures that differ significantly from those already observed. In this example, 6NM2 is the best sampled peptide, followed by CLN025, and finally FipWW (for which we can reasonably expect to observe new and very different structures if we were to continue the simulation).
