These are the results from a 6.3 Î¼s folding simulation of the CLN025 peptide
using the AMBER-99SB-ILDN force field. 

The graphs are in the PDF files (as produced by R). 

The file 'Screenshot.png' is the log produced on the interactive shell.

The file 'Comparison.png' illustrates the form of the results for folding
simulations of different peptides/proteins (and with different simulations 
lengths).
